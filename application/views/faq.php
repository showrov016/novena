		<p>1. What does Doctrine of the Catholic Church mean?
It comes from the Latin and means a code of belief and must 
be believed and adhered to in the Catholic Church.  <br><br>


2. What does a novena mean?
Novena means nine.  It is private or public specific prayers 
for 9 hours, 9 days or even 90 days. <br><br>

3. What is its origin?
The 9 days that Mary and the Disciples spent together 
between Ascension Thursday and Pentecost. <br><br>

4. What does the word purgatory mean?
Purgation is the process of God’s love changing our imperfect 
selves into perfect beings. <br><br>

5. Why do we pray for the souls in purgatory?
They cannot pray for themselves as they cannot pay the debt 
back because of their imprisonment (purgatory) and thus 
when they get to heaven they will be eternally grateful to us 
and will show it in their prayers. It is also a great kindness to 
help them get to heaven. <br><br>

6. Why do we I need to pray for someone who is very holy?
Imagine that Mother Theresa of Calcutta and the late; great 
Pope John Paul II requested prayers for their souls! Thus we 
rest our case!<br><br>

7. Why do we need to pray for these Holy Souls?
First of all, we do not want to fall into presumption thinking 
they are already in heaven as only God knows the recesses 
of their hearts and we can never judge a persons salvation or 
motivation, only actions.  No prayer is ever wasted and if 
they are in heaven God will use these prayers for His greater 
glory.  And, finally because they can no longer pray for 
themselves and will be eternally grateful for our assistance in 
releasing them.<br><br>

8. How do our prayers release a specific soul from purgatory?
Well on an earthly level let’s say you went to jail (purgatory) 
because you stole something but you cannot pay it back 
simply because you’re in jail.  So let’s say you have a friend 
that says they will pay back the money you stole (our 
intercessory prayers) if the court (God) would give them a 
reduced sentence (partial indulgence) or a full pardon 
(plenary indulgence). <br><br>

9. Who goes to purgatory?
Everyone who is not perfect at the moment of death and is 
not condemned to hell.  “The soul will receive from God 
exactly what she desires.”  St. Therese of the Child Jesus. <br><br>

10. Are the souls in heaven perfect?
Yes. <br><br>

11. Are you perfect now?
No, thus purgatory is a great gift of mercy in that everyone 
who is in purgatory goes to heaven. <br><br>

12. What is an indulgence?
It means to be kind or tender and originally meant kindness 
or a favor.  It also meant the remission of a tax or debt. It 
was used to release from captivity or punishment.  Isaiah 
61:1.  You indulge in prayer or sacrifice for someone else to 
obtain favors. <br><br>

13. What does the penalty for sin mean?
It’s the consequences of our wrong choices—even though we 
said we were sorry and received absolution. <br><br>

14. If my sins are forgiven then why would I go to purgatory?
Great question!  It’s like if I broke a window on purpose (sin) 
and said I was sorry (confession) I would still have to pay for 
the window (purgatory).  I can do this on earth through 
holiness of life, acts of charity, penances. <br><br>

15. How can I avoid purgatory?
Perfect love of God and Neighbor which of course takes grace 
(prayer, sacrifice and almsgiving) and works (charitable acts 
and kindness, etc).  We must have total trust in the mercy of 
Jesus as it is this trust that will help us avoid purgatory.  
Jesus does not want us to go to purgatory, He wants us totally 
united with Him during this life and then continuing into 
eternity.  Jesus I Trust in You! <br><br>

16. What if someone doesn’t believe in purgatory?
Remember my belief or your belief doesn’t change reality.  I 
would pray for that person and tell them to read the Bible, the 
Catechism, the Councils of the Church & the Church Fathers 
and basically just search and study.  God is faithful and if 
they’re open to Truth the Holy Spirit will guide them. <br><br>

17. What is a plenary indulgence?
It is full pardon of the consequences of sin.  (Release from 
purgatory).  When St. Therese was dying she states, “I beg 
you, don’t prevent me from saying my prayers for the dead; 
it’s the only thing I can do for the sisters who are in 
Purgatory.” <br><br>

18. What is sin?
Sin is a transgression of theological principles and the 
rejection of the saving power of Jesus’ suffering and death on 
the cross.  We consider it to be insanity to live even one 
moment in mortal sin, but refuse to minimize any sin; all sin 
is rooted in fear rather than trust in God and perfect love 
casts out all fear. It is a thought, word or deed done against 
love, the Great Commandment, the Ten Commandments, the 
beatitudes or the precepts of the Church.  “The righteous man 
sins seven times a day”. Proverbs 24:16 <br><br>

19. What if someone says that Jesus already paid the price and 
He is the only atonement we need?
Another great question.  Let’s suppose you paid for your 
child’s college and your child didn’t fulfill the requirements for 
graduation.  You might say, “well they should graduate, 
because I paid the price.”  However, graduation only comes 
after they fulfill the requirements; just because the bill is paid 
doesn’t mean automatic graduation.  Jesus paid the price, but 
He demands that we keep his commandments and fulfill the 
requirements of Love of God and Neighbor….which is a daily 
and sometimes hourly challenge.</p>
